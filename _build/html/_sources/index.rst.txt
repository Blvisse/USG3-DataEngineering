Welcome to USG3's documentation!
================================

The USGS 3DEP project (United States Geological Survey 3D Elevation Program) aims at responding to growing needs for high-quality topographic data and a wide range of 3D data representation of the countyâ€™s features. You can read about the full project here. The data is stored in a repository on an amazon server. The server contains geospatial data on over 1000 geographical regions. The data stored is in a .ept JSON file format. Entwine Point Tile format (ept)is a simple way to store data. It achieves this by a simple tree-based format. To enable processing ept has crucial keys that enable smooth processing. The dataset is however very complicated to understand

Hence this project aims to create a package to interact with the data and process it into a less complex file, example of code interaction can be found in the notebook labeled scriptdemeonstration.ipynb

All package dependancies can be found in the requirements.txt file
